Here is a collection of words you may encounter in the user interface, and in documentation, that may not be clear. Please report anything that is not in this list that is confusing. I wrote the software, so this stuff makes sense to me, so I don't always know.

1. Inspecting: Inspecting refers to getting a "closer look" at information. This will single out the targeted data, and display it in a "Property: Value" based format. 
2. Toolbar: The toolbar refers to the top section of the app's content. This is a common place to put useful buttons & commands. It also displays the current workspace name on the top left.
3. Compact vs Full Sized Mode: Some screens are smaller than others. Because of this, Edmund must go into a "compact" mode. This is so that information can still be displayed, but in a format adapted to smaller screens. When iPadOS apps get put in slideover, or in small orientations for "windowed mode" (iPadOS 26 and beyond), or on iOS devices, the app will switch to compact mode. Any other time, it will be "full sized" mode. This will take advantage of the bigger screen size and display more information. Note that macOS does not use compact sizes. All macOS information is in "full sized" mode.
