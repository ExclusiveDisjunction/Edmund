The homepage is the first thing you are greeted with, and shows you basic details about your finances. This tool can be used to see bills at a glance, spending, balances, and much more! This is a guide on what the homepage can show you. 

## Simple & Detailed Balances
Both widgets display how much money you have in each account. The only difference is that detailed balances will show you the balances in each sub-account as well. Either way, this is a summary of the information found on the Balances page of the main window.

## Upcoming Bills
Upcoming bills shows you the most relevant bills, and their costs. It will determine the next few bills that are about to come due, and present this to you. This way, you can always stay up to date!

## Spending Graph
This widget shows you a chart graph showing spending over time. It collects the total money in and out each month, and displays this as either one or two bars. THere are two modes to this widget: *Net Spending* and *Individual Spending*. Net spending shows you each month's money in and out as one bar. If it is green, there was a net positive money flow for that month. If it is red, then there was a net negative money flow. This can show you if, on average, each month you are spending or making money. The individual spending mode shows you the money in and money out as two separate bars. The money in is green, and shows above the horizontal 0 line. The red is the money out, and shows below the horizontal 0 line. This can show you the split amounts that the net spending will not.

## Balances Graph
This widget shows you a pie chart of your current balances. It only considers positive balance accounts. For example, if you had $800 in Savings, and $200 in Checking, your pie chart would have 80% for Savings, and 20% for checking.
