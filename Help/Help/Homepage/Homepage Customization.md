The homepage allows customization. This customization includes:
1. Determining the overall layout of the homepage
2. Determining the splitting of the homepage elements (if applicable)
3. Choosing which widgets you want in what locations. 

## Accessing the Homepage Customizer
There are two ways of accessing the customizer:
1. Settings: Open the settings -> Go to the tab 'Homepage' -> Follow instructions below
    1. Note on macOS, to open settings: Press Command + , or Press Edmund -> Settings (in the menu bar), or press the gear on the homepage.
    2. On iOS and iPadOS: press the gear on the homepage.
2. Homepage: Press the Homepage Customizer button (Appears as an icon with 3 rectangles on it)

## Major Layout Choice
Edmund offers 4 major layouts:
1. Horizontal Split: Split the homepage into two sections horizontally.
2. Vertical Split: Split the homepage into two sections vertically.
3. Full Screen: Display only one widget, taking up the whole homepage.
4. Scroll: Displays four widgets, one on top of the other. You can scroll through the widgets to see all of them.

Note that for iOS, and for iPadOS in slideover/split screen, Scroll is the only displayed option. This is because the other orientations cannot fit. 

While in the Homepage Customizer, to change the layout, simply select which layout you want in the top picker. It will change the preview to reflect your changes.

## Split Choices
In the Horizontal and Vertical split layout choice, you have the option to split the sections into one section, or two. This allows you to have a maximum of 4 total widgets displayed at one time.

While in the Homepage Customizer, if Horizontal or Vertical split choices are active, an additional two pickers show up. These contain the options "One Section" and "Two Sections". Changing this will update the preview to include your changes. 

## Widget Choices
Once the layout and split choices (if applicable) have been made, the preview will refect a rough outline of how the homepage will look. To choose which widgets show up where, simply pick the widget you want from the picker in the middle of each purple rectangle. For a list of widgets and their functions, please see the Homepage topic.
