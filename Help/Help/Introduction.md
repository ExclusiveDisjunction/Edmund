Welcome to Edmund, your personal finance software!

Edmund is a software bundle designed to help you with the tedious work of personal finances, providing a rich set of tools. These tools include simplified bookeeping, bills tracking, payday & tax help, and reporting. This guide is meant to help you understand the different ways to use the software, not a guide on how to do personal finances. For that information, please see the Finances section of the help menu. 

The following articles will guide you on the major elements of the user interface, as well as explaining how to use different features.

As always, if a bug is found, please report it. This information is in the about menu. On macOS, navigate to Help -> About in the menu bar. On iOS and iPadOS, please go to the settings, and press 'About'.
