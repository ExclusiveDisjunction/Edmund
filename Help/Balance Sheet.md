The ledger is able to store all transactions, and allows for a fine grained history of spending/earning, but it does not show the full picture. This is where the **Balance sheet** comes in. It is able to show all balances across your accounts. Here is an overview of the data displayed on sheet:

## Full sized mode
This mode shows up on macOS and iPadOS (wide sizes).

| Column    | Meaning                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name      | The account that the balance is associated with         |
| Money In  | A sum total of the money that has come into the account |
| Money Out | A sum total of the money that has left the account      |
| Balance   | The current amount of money in the account              |
## Compact mode
This mode shows up on iOS and iPadOS (compact sizes). This shows less information. 

| Column  | Meaning                                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Name    | The account that the balance is associated with |
| Balance | The current amount of money in the account      |

***Note***: The balance sheet is computed when you open the tool. If you add transactions, you must refresh the balance sheet if it was kept open.
