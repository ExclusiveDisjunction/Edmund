Categories are a way to group transactions together. In the context of your budget, it is used to track spending. Categories are very simple, just a name and a description. However, with these two things, you are able to help keep yourself organized. 

On macOS and iPadOS (wide sizes), the name, description, and lock status is shown. On iOS and compact iPadOS, the name and lock status is shown. 

***Note***: Categories with a lock on them are created by Edmund, and cannot be removed/edited. These are used to create the transaction templates.
