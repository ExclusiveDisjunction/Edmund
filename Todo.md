# To do & Left Off

Work will be intermittent on this project, due to school work. Here is a note where I left off & what to improve/work on.

1. Transform Transaction editors to be in sheets, use forms, and implement functionality for CreditCardTrans.
2. Bind the SubCategory and SubAccount to LedgerEntry with a One (LE) to many (SC/SA). (DONE) 
3. Possibly fix the bug where the panels will be collapsed by default on AllNamedPairViewEdit.
4. Determine if you can combine the Utilities and Bills pages together with tabs, if needed.
5. Put the settings for the iOS/iPadOS version on the homepage
6. Redesign the homepage, include links/figures/notes
7. By default, the AllNamedPairsViewEdit, AllBillsViewEdit, and AllUtilitiesViewEdit will delete the bound entry on edit if they have no name/parent. THis should probably be avoided.
8. Figure out undo/redo, add them to the appropriate menus for iPadOS/iOS, command shortcuts for macOS
9. Determine methods for fixing UI on small screen sizes. For example, on budget, ensure that the required data is shown in small resolutions.
